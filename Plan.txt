A user connects to the web portal. They send a request to the server. 
The server finds the user's specific bot configuration.
It sends a message to create a new instance.
It tells it to download the base repo of the bot.
It then uploads a list of settings to the base.
The server then tells the base to download all the packages. It can find the git repos by looking up our API.
It then runs the bot.

Change the bot so it doesn't use global namespace, but namespace allocated for each bot.
